AWS Terms:

1. AWS Amplify: is an operation to help developers host and maintain front-end
   applications. It helps with data storage, analytics, push notifications and
   authentification ([Blue Matador]).
2. Amazon Resource Names (ARNs): "uniquely identify AWS resources, allowing a
   resource to be unambiguously identified across all of AWS" ([Amazon]).
3. Amazon API Gateway: An API gateway redirects API calls to the appropriate
   backend device(s), and returns the results. An API gateway feeds input and
   relays output from the API management system ([Red Hat]). Amazon API Gateway
   is an Amazon service for an API gateway.
4. API gateway "stage": "A logical reference to a lifecycle state of your API
   (for example, 'dev', 'prod', 'beta', 'v2'). API stages are identified by API
   ID and stage name" ([Amazon 2]).
